    "1) How would you define Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is a subclass of artificial intelligence that collects any type of data, recognizes its patterns, learn from it and create a model\n",
    "until it can answer our questions about the data and data related subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning? Specify example 3 algorithms for each of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that unsupervised learning has no corresponding output although it has also an input(X).\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the type that we use when we have a specific question for our data. For example; we want to know if the \n",
    "flights will be cancelled or not, due to some data we have(cancelled 1, or not 0), or we have some features to determine a group of people's\n",
    "genders and we are trying to predict it using our data(a boy 0, or a girl 1), or we want to estimate people's house prices due to\n",
    "some qualities that we create in our data's features to give our customer a last price for their houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For unsupervised learning, we don't have a specific question to ask our data. Unsupervised learning mostly means \n",
    "clustering or assosiating the data. There is no specific result that our data needs to be used to reach, we just use it to have a\n",
    "deeper and better understanding of our data. For example; Spotify using their customers' playlists and analyze it to recommend more suitable\n",
    "songs or genres for a person(my dreamjob) or a hospital using their emergency service patients' data to understand how to advance their facilities\n",

    "\n",
    "Validation set is actually a part of the training set. It is used during tuning for parameter selection to prevent overfitting \n",
    "because when we tune the model with the training dataset there is a chance it'll work with %100 accuracy.\n",
